#Book Catalog

The BookCatalog class is responsible for managing a collection of books and provides methods to add books and search for books by different criteria.

The main part of the code provides a simple command-line interface for users to interact with the book catalog. Users can choose various options:

Add a book: Users can add a new book to the catalog by providing information about the book (title, author, genre, publication year).

Search by title: Users can search for books by entering a title. The catalog will display all books that match the given title.

Search by author: Users can search for books by entering an author's name. The catalog will display all books written by the specified author.

Each option corresponds to a specific block of code that handles the user input and performs the corresponding actions. The book catalog stores the books in a list, which allows easy addition and searching.

Keep in mind that this is a simple example, and in a real-world scenario, you might want to consider using a database or a more sophisticated data structure to store and manage the book catalog. Additionally, you could enhance the user interface or add more features to make the catalog more user-friendly and versatile.
