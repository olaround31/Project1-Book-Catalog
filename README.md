Book Catalog

The BookCatalog class is responsible for managing a collection of books and provides methods to add books and search for books by different criteria.

Add a book: Users can add a new book to the catalog by providing information about the book (title, author, genre, publication year).

Search by title: Users can search for books by entering a title. The catalog will display all books that match the given title.

Search by author: Users can search for books by entering an author's name. The catalog will display all books written by the specified author.
