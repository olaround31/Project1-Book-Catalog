#BOOK CATALOG


The BookCatalog class is responsible for managing a collection of books and provides methods to add books and search for books by different criteria.

The main part of the code provides a simple command-line interface for users to interact with the book catalog. Users can choose various options:

Add a book: Users can add a new book to the catalog by providing information about the book (title, author, genre, publication year).

Search by title: Users can search for books by entering a title. The catalog will display all books that match the given title.

Search by author: Users can search for books by entering an author's name. The catalog will display all books written by the specified author.

Each option corresponds to a specific block of code that handles the user input and performs the corresponding actions. The book catalog stores the books in a list, which allows easy addition and searching.

Keep in mind that this is a simple example, and in a real-world scenario, you might want to consider using a database or a more sophisticated data structure to store and manage the book catalog. Additionally, you could enhance the user interface or add more features to make the catalog more user-friendly and versatile.
#index.html
The filename "index.html" typically refers to the main entry point of a website or web application. In web development, it's a convention to name the main HTML file of a website "index.html" because most web servers are configured to look for and serve this file by default when someone accesses the root directory of a domain or a subdirectory.

When a user enters a domain name (e.g., www.example.com) in their web browser, the server will automatically look for the "index.html" file in the root directory and return its content to the user's browser. If the file is found, the browser will render the HTML content and display the website's contents to the user.

The "index.html" file contains the structure and content of the main page of the website. It's usually written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which is the standard markup language for creating web pages. The file may also include CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript code to control the layout and interactivity of the web page.

Here's a basic example of what an "index.html" file might contain:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Welcome to My Website</title>
    <!-- Additional meta tags, CSS links, or other head content may go here -->
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <!-- Navigation menu or other header content can go here -->
    </header>

    <main>
        <!-- Main content of the website -->
        <p>Hello, world! This is my website.</p>
    </main>

    <footer>
        <!-- Footer content and links can go here -->
        <p>&copy; 2023 My Website. All rights reserved.</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

Please note that the actual content and structure of the "index.html" file will vary depending on the specific website and its design. Additionally, web development practices and technologies may have evolved since my last update in September 2021, so keep that in mind while developing your website.
